## What Will You Learn {.scrollable .smaller}

-   Format a table (csv file) with addresses to ensure ArcGIS Online can geocode the table
-   How to use geocoding to create a feature layer with location encoding from a table (csv file) with correctly formatted addresses.

## Why Geocoding

Often the observations in a data table do not contain latitude and longitude information, but they contain addresses.

**Geocoding** can be used to transform addresses to location information in a feature layer.

The observations from the table with addresses can then be displayed on a map as points.

## Address Formats Accepted by ArcGIS Online

1.  All address information is contained in one column of the table such as:

2.  Location information is in separate columns:

Our table has the address info in several columns formated as above.

## How to Geocode {.smaller}

1.  Generate a new map or use an existing map.

2.  Use the + sign to add a new Feature Layer:

3.  Choose `Add Layer from File` and chhose the CSV file.

4.  Choose `Create hosted feature layer`

5.  Add the data type of your fields (e.g., ZIP should be String)

6.  Choose `Location information is in multiple fields` scrool down and complete the address field assignments and check the Credit costs. Only after you did all this click `Next`

## How to Geocode with incomplete Address (e.g., only Zip)

Use the procedure as before but only assign ZIP code

**All records will be located in the ZIP code Centrois**

## What Will You Learn {.scrollable}

-   Load a csv table to *My Content*

-   Add a table to a *Web Map*

-   What a relational database is

-   Joining two tables into one table based on matching observations

    -   Left Join
    -   Inner Join
    -   Outer or Full Join (rarely used)

-   Join a *FeatureLayer*'s table with a *Table* in a *Web Ma*p

## ArcGis Online:

1.  Load Web map from `SchoolQualityMapYourInitial` from *My Content*

**Problem:** No school quality reported

## Adding Table with School Quality to ArcGIS Online

**We start with:** Showing School Quality in R: `Schools.R` (this step is not required)

## ArcGis Online: Add table to Map

1.  Generate a new map or use an existing map.

2.  Use the + sign to add a new Feature Layer:

    ![](images/clipboard-3277988701.png)

3.  Choose `Add Layer from File` and choose the CSV file: `SchoolQualityYourInitial.`

4.  Choose `Create hosted feature layer`

5.  Add the data type of your fields (e.g., CDS should be String)

6.  Choose `None`

**Problem:** One layer has no school quality and the SchoolQuality table has no location information.

**Solution:** Both have a school identifier (CDS code). So, we can join them.

## Joining two Tables {.smaller .scrollable}

Programs that allow joining two tables are called **relational databases**

```{r}
#| echo: false
Orders
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
NameAdresses
```

## Definition Left Join

A **Left Join** on two tables joins the observations from both tables and **keeps all records from the left table and only matching observations from the right table** (the first mentioned table is the left table and the second is the right table)



## Joining two Tables (Left Join) {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
```{r}
#| echo: false
Orders
```
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
```{r}
#| echo: false
NameAdresses
```
:::
:::

**Left Join**

. . .

```{r}
left_join(Orders,NameAdresses, by=join_by(ID==ID))
```

## Definition Inner Join

An **Inner Join** on two tables joins the observations from both tables but **keeps only observations that have data in both tables**

## Joining two Tables (Inner Join) {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
```{r}
#| echo: false
Orders
```
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
```{r}
#| echo: false
NameAdresses
```
:::
:::

**Inner Join**

. . .

```{r}
inner_join(Orders,NameAdresses, by=join_by(ID==ID))
```

## Definition Outer Join

An **Outer Join** on two tables joins the observations from both tables and **keeps all records regardless of a match**



## Joining two Tables (Outer Join)

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
```{r}
#| echo: false
Orders
```
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
```{r}
#| echo: false
NameAdresses
```
:::
:::

**Outer Join**

. . .

```{r}
full_join(Orders,NameAdresses, by=join_by(ID==ID))
```

## Joining two Tables in ArcGis Online

1.  Back to the web map `SchoolQualityYourInitial`

If you have not done it already:

2.  Add Table (table icon on the left)
3.  Choose: `DataSchoolQuality`
4.  both have a school identifier (CDS code)

Joining based on attributes/features:

5.  **Joining:** Analysis -\> Summarize Data -\> Join Features Result Layer: `SchoolQualityWithAdrYourInitial` Folder: `EC4448Schools`

**Save Web map!!!**

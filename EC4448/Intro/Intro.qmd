## What Will You Learn {.scrollable}

-   Details about te project to estimate house prices in Los Angeles County
- How data are stored in tables in general
- How data tables with location information can be stored in ArcGIS Online 
- How Latitude and Longitude can be used to reference any point on earth


## Project Goal of the Course {.smaller}

We have data to estimate Los Angeles County House Prices:

$$
\widehat{Price}=\beta_1 Sqft + \beta_2 Bedrooms + \beta3
$$

Running an OLS Regression leads to:

```{r}
ModelOLS=lm(Price~Sqft+Bedrooms, data=DataHouses)
Result=tidy(ModelOLS)
print(Result)
```

$$
\widehat{Price}=\underbrace{507}_{\beta_1} \cdot Sqft - \underbrace{83251}_{\beta_2} \cdot Bedrooms + \underbrace{311,211}_{\beta3}
$$

## The Goal is to Consider Location Information

Such as:

$$\begin{align}
\widehat{Price}&=\beta_1 Sqft + \beta_2 Bedrooms + \beta3 NearSchoolQuality \\
\\
&+
                \beta_4 DistBeach + \beta_5 Income + \ldots
\end{align}$$

## Data are Usually Stored in Tables (e.g., Excel sheets)

**Rows** are holding the **observations**.

**Columns** are holding **variables/features**.

E.g., tables can be stored in **Excel sheets**:

## Data are Usually Stored in Tables(e.g., *R* data frame variables)

**Rows** are holding the **observations**.

**Columns** are holding **variables/features**.

E.g., tables can be stored in **data frames variables in R**:

```{r}
NameAdresses=tibble(ID=c(1,22,3,4,5,6),
                    First=c("John","Joe","Jake",
                            "Hans","Anne", "Agatha"),                   
                    Last=c("Doe","Dull","Dune",
                          "Meier","Scholz","Smith"),
                    Street=c("649 C Street","648 A Street", "345 H Street",
                           "118 B Street","120 B Street","876 G Street"),
                    City=c("Pomona","Pomona","Pomona", 
                         "Pomona","Pomona","Pomona"))
print(NameAdresses)
```

## Data are Usually Stored in Tables (e.g., CSV files)

**Rows** are holding the **observations**.

**Columns** are holding **variables/features**.

E.g., tables can be stored in **CSV** (comma separated values) files:

## Longitude-Latitude

Lat-Long is a coordinate system for locations. Latitude represents the vertical axis, and Longitude represents the horizontal axis.

## Location Data (e.g., points)

Data with Lat-Long Information (e.g., Observations that are points on earth) are stored in ArcGIS Online in a (hosted) **Feature Layer**.
<br>
<br>
Basically, one or more layers on top of a **Base Map**.




**Think of overlayed transparencies on a projector**

## ArcGis Online: Location Data (e.g., points)

1.  Load new map with Basemap only.

2.  Show (`DataPublSchlsAdr.csv`) in EC4448Data

3.  Add School Points with addresses to a ArcGIS Online *Web Map*
    Map -\> Layers -\> Add -\> Add Layer from file (`DataPublSchlsAdr.csv`)

4.  *Web Map*: Save as ... `SchoolQualityYourInitial` into your group (into a new folder: `EC4448SchoolsGroupYourInitial`

5.  Note that the file has no school quality info. 
    The info about school quality is a different file.

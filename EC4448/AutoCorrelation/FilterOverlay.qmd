- How to identify a hot spot (high feature value) and a cold spot (low feature value)

## Tobler's Law and Spatial Auto Correlation

**First Law of Geography:**

> Everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things. (Waldo Rudolph Tobler (1930 â€“ 2018)

Spatial autocorrelation is present when point values influence the values of their neighbors.

In other words, if a point with a high value is surrounded by points with high values (***Hot Spot***) \
and/or\
if a point with a low value is surrounded by points with low values (***Cold Spot***)

## Hot Spot Cold Spot Analysis (Getis\`s i) {.smaller}

Note, Getis's i is calculated for each point separately

"Getis\`s i" is a z-Value. Therefore, we can assign a P -P-value that expresses the probability that we see the high or low value just by accident.

## Hot Spot Cold Spot Analysis in ArcGIS Online {.smaller}

-   Choose the `Analysis` icon in the right menu bar

-   `Analyze Patterns -> Find Hot Spots`

-   Set the `Analysis Field` to the variable you would like to analyze.

-   Set Output Name to the name of the result feature layer you choose

-   `Estimate credits` and `Run`

**Interpretation:**

-   Dark (light) red indicates a **hot spot** with a probability of more than 95% (90%) significance

-   Dark (light) blue indicates a **cold spot** with a probability of more than 95% (90%) significance

-   Grey indicates a significance below 90%

## What is KNIME?

KNIME is an alternative to R and Python for those who do not want to code.

You can use drag and drop statistical tasks (nodes) to create an analysis workflow.

Knime is free and can be downloaded at: <https://www.knime.com/downloads>

## KNIME vs. Excel

-   Copy and Paste in Excel is prone to error

-   *EXCEL* research is difficult or impossible to reproduce because it leaves no trail

    -   *R* and *Python* leave the code.

    -   KNIME leaves the workflow nodes

-   Reproducibility is important

    -   for credibility
    -   for your future you, when you like to work on an older project

## What Will be Covered

-   A Basic Example: Comparing Means with KNIME

-   A linear Regression with KNIME: Wage Discrimination in 1976

-   Comparing the results of a k-Nearest Neighbor Machine Learning model between R and KNIME

## Comparing Male and Female Wages in 1976

## Data

[Wooldridge Dataset](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/wooldridge/wooldridge.pdf) ([download here](https://econ.lange-analytics.com/RData/Datasets/DataWage.xlsx))

## Comparing Means

Did male workers receive a larger wage than female workers?

## Regression

**Basic Wage Regression:**

$$
Wage=\beta_1 SexFem+\beta_2 Exp + \beta_3 Educ
$$ **Advanced Wage Regression:**

$$
ln(Wage)=\beta_1 SexFem+\beta_2 Exp^2 + \beta_3 Educ+ \beta_4 MSAYes
$$

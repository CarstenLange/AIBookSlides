-   You will review the concept of Range, Absolute Deviation, Variance and Standard deviation to measure the spread of a variable.
-   You will review histogram diagrams
-   You will review the concept of Standard Deviation to measure the spread of a variable in more detail.
-   You will explain why Standard Deviation is so important for the concept of Normal Distribution.

## Some Questions to Introduce Center and Spread

::: {.incremental}
-   Who runs faster, men or women? 
    - Is this true for all men and women?

-   Who is taller, men or women? 
    - Is this true for all men and women?

-   What is it the average temperature in Michigan/Coastal California? 
    Why is the climate different in te two states?

-   Which of your products shows high or low volatility in sales? 
    - Why is that?
    - Why is it important?

## How are Critical Diabetes/Chlosterol Values and other Blood Test Values Determined {.smaller}

Diabetics values are *normal distributed.*

**Normal Distribution:**

- Most values are in the center. 
- Some are larger or smaller than the center. 
- Few are a lot larger or smaller than the center. 
- Very few are extremely large or smaller
- The distribution is symmetric around the mean, leading to a bell curve.

For women 45 -- 54 years, the mean is 230.5 mg/100 ml cholesterol, and the standard deviation is 50.0 (source: <https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/series/sr_11/sr11_022.pdf>)

## Synthetic Data for 10,000 Women (45 - 54 years)

### Histogram with Relative Frequencies as Column Height

```{r}
library(TeachHist)
TeachHistRelFreq(Mean=230.5, Sd=50, SeedValue=123, NOfSimData=10000)
```

Empirical rule, also known as theÂ 68-95-99.7 rule.

### Histogram with Relative Frequencies as Column Area

```{r}
TeachHistDens(Mean=230.5, Sd=50, SeedValue=123, NOfSimData=10000, PlotNormCurv = FALSE)
```

Try column just right of mean: 0.0068\*50=0.34

### Histogram with Relative Frequencies as Column Area and Normal Curve

```{r}
#| echo: false
TeachHistDens(Mean=230.5, Sd=50, SeedValue=123, NOfSimData=10000, PlotNormCurv = TRUE)
```

## Normal Curve {.smaller}

- Most values are in the center. 
- Some are larger or smaller than the center. 
- Few are a lot larger or smaller than the center. 
- Very few are extremely large or small.
- The distribution is symmetric around the mean, leading to a bell curve.

$$
Density = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}} e^{-\frac{(x - \mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}
$$

where:
- $\mu$ is the mean
- $\sigma$ is the standard deviation

```{r}
#| echo: false
ggplot(data.frame(x = c(30.5, 430.5)), aes(x = x)) +
stat_function(fun = dnorm, args = list(mean = 230.5, sd = 50)) +
labs(title = "Normal Distribution", x = "x", y = "Density")+
scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(0,450,25))+
geom_vline(xintercept = 230.5, color="red")
```

```

`pnorm(x, mean=???, sd=???)` calculates the probability of getting a value smaller than x. **Try:**

- `pnorm(480, mean=230.5, sd=50)`

-   `pnorm(130.5, mean=230.5, sd=50)`

-   `pnorm(330.5, mean=230.5, sd=50)-pnorm(130.5, mean=230.5, sd=50)`

## Normal Curve Women (45 - 54 years) wit Mean: 230.5, SD=50

```{r}
#| echo: false
TeachHistDens(Mean=230.5, Sd=50, SeedValue=123, NOfSimData=10000, PlotNormCurv = TRUE)
```

`qnorm(x, mean=???, sd=???)` calculates the quantity for P percent of the values falling below that quantity.**Try:**

-   `qnorm(.5, mean=230.5, sd=50)`
-   `qnorm(.02, mean=230.5, sd=50)`
-   `qnorm(.05, mean=230.5, sd=50)`
-   `qnorm(.95, mean=230.5, sd=50)` (meaning 5% are above this level)

## Distribution Other Than Normal Distribution

- Bernoulli 
- Uniform

# Introduction to Machine Learning

## What is What?

-   Artificial Intelligence (AI),
-   Machine Learning,
-   Deep Learning

## What About Big Data

## What About Big Data

-   Big Data is not a category of learning. It is a category of data!!!
-   Two common definitions
    -   Laymen: Many records (thousands?, millions?, billions?)
    -   Experts: So many records that they do not fit in the memory of one computer.
        -   At least billions of records.
        -   Requires distributed computing.

## Three Applications of Machine Learning {auto-animate="true"}

::: nonincremental
-   Regression
-   Classification
-   Cluster
:::

## Three Applications of Machine Learning {.smaller auto-animate="true"}

::: nonincremental
-   Regression
    -   Outcome variable is continuous
    -   We try to predict a numerical value
-   Classification
-   Cluster

::: nonincremental
-   Regression
-   Classification
    -   Outcome variable is categorial
    -   Most of the times 2 categories such as:
        -   Yes/No
        -   Red Wine/White Wine
        -   True/False
        -   often represented as dummies: 1/0
    -   Sometimes more than two catogories (ordered or unordered):
        -   good, fair, bad (ordered)
        -   red, blue, green (unordered)
        -   strongly agree, agree, disagree, strongly disagree (ordered)
-   Cluster

::: nonincremental
-   Regression
-   Classification
-   Cluster
    -   Sorting observations into a number of groups based on feature variables.
    -   Groups are as homogenous inside as possible.
    -   Groups are as diverse between groups (when comparing groups)

## Terminolgy {.smaller}

First 3 Observations (records) of the Housing Dataset (to predict house prices)

```{r}
#| echo: true
library(rio);library(tidyverse)
DataHousing =
  import("https://lange-analytics.com/AIBook/Data/HousingData.csv") %>% 
  select(Price=price, Sqft=sqft_living, Bedrooms=bedrooms,Waterfront=waterfront)
print(DataHousing[1:3,])
```

Tidy data:

-   Observations (synonym: records) are in the rows.
-   Variables (synonym: features) are in the columns.
-   Variable names (column names) are in the first row.
-   Data are in individual cells (and they form vectors; column names can be interpreted as vector names).

### Main

First 3 Observations (records) of the Housing Dataset (predict house prices)

```{r}
#| echo: true
library(rio);library(tidyverse)
DataHousing =
  import("https://lange-analytics.com/AIBook/Data/HousingData.csv") %>% 
  select(Price=price, Sqft=sqft_living, Bedrooms=bedrooms,Waterfront=waterfront)
print(DataHousing[1:3,])
```

-   **Outcome Variable**: The variables that is the outcome of the prediction ($Price$)

-   **Predictor Variables**: The variables that **predict** an outcome ($Sqft$, $Bedrooms$, $Waterfront$)

-   **Example linear regression:** $Price=\beta_1 \cdot Sqft+ \beta_2 \cdot Bedrooms +\beta_3 \cdot Waterfront+\beta_4$

### Synonyms

-   **Synonyms for Outcome Variable:**

    ::: nonincremental
    -   Response variable (it responds to the predictors)
    -   Dependent variable (it is dependent on the predictors)
    -   Endogenous variable (it is dependent on the predictors)
    :::

-   **Synonyms for Predictor Variables:**

    ::: nonincremental
    -   Explanatory variables variables (they explain the outcome)
    -   Independent variables (they are chosen independently to see how the impact the outcome)
    -   Exogenous variable (they are chosen independently to see how the impact the outcome)

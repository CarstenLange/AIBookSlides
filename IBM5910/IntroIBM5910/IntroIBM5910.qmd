## Success in The Course

::: incremental
- Use AI responsible
- Read the textbook
- Follow the Learning Guide!!!
- Read read the syllabus
:::

## Course Content

::: incremental

- Basic Statistics Concept
- Data Engineering with R
- Data Visualization
- Data reporting with Quarto
  - Writing Paper
  - Developing Power Point Slides

:::

## Why R?

::: incremental

- Excel analytics is not reproducible
- SPSS focuses on surveys
- STATA and SAS are commercial products
  - not free
  - progress has to go through the corporate hierachie and therefore is slower
  - limited support community

:::

## R and/or Python

::: incremental
- Analysis is always reproducible with little effort
- free
- extensive support
- R or Python
  - R is easier to understand for users with limited coding experience
  - Python is faster in incorporating cutting-edge algorithms
  - transfer from R to Python or vice versa is easy
  - Quarto supports both R and Python even simultaneously in the same project

## Quantitative Analysis


::: incremental

1. **Logical Model** based on domain knowledge.  
   *Example:* A new webdesign should help increase sales.
   
2. **Quantitative Model** that is general. It is not fitted to data (*unfitted model*)  
   *Example:* The daily mean the sales amount for the new webdesign should be higher than the one for the original webdesign
   
3. **Sample Statitics** based on a samble of $N$ observations that confirms what was stated under topic 2 (or not)  
   **Example:** Track sales on both websites with randomly assigned users over 365 days and calculate the sample means. Compare the sample means and *additionally* run tests if your results are rleible (significant).  
   **Note:** The means you calculated from the sample are not the same as the means mentioned under topic 2. They are only **estimates** of the general (population) means.

## What Will You Learn 

- How the logic of Treatment and Control leads to *A/B Testing*

- Requirements for a successful A/B test

- Possible violations of the requirements and the consequences

- What one can do when it is not possible to fulfill the requirements

## A/B-Test

A very powerful and easy to use methodology to compare means of one or more *Treatment* groups to a *Control Group*.

. . .

**Goal:** Determine if a treatment (e.g., number of conversions for a new websites (*Treatment*)) is significant compared to the old website (*Control Group*).

. . .

**Methodology:** Two Sample t-Test

. . .

**Requirement:** Participants must be randomly assigned to the groups (no self-selection!).

. . .

**Problem:** While it is easy and technically straightforward to randomly assign website visitors to different webpages, it can be difficult or impossible in other cases.

. . .

For example, it is not feasible to assign participants of a marketing event into a treatment group (drank a glass of champagne before the talk) and a control group (did not drink a glass of champagne before the talk)

## The Idea Behind A/B Tests

### Ideal: Parallel Universes

**Problem:** We cannot observe counterfactuals

### Second Best: Randomly Chosen Subjects

![](images/clipboard-1689822553.png)

If *Treatment* and *Control* group subjects are chosen entirely at random and if we have a large number of subjects, we can assume that any characteristics of subjects that influence the outcome is equally present in *Treatment* and *Control* group

## Example: Webdesign in Marketing

### Conversion Data (synthetic) for a New Website Compared to the Original Website

New website is *Treatment* old website is *Control* group

**Purchase value data from the last 100 visitors who purchased on each of the websites:**

```{r}
library(rio)
library(tidyverse)
library(TeachHist)
DataWebSites=import("DataWebSites.csv")[,2:3]
head(DataWebSites)
```

## Mean and Standard Errors for Control and Treatment

**Control Group:**

```{r}
cat("Mean of Control Group is:", mean(DataWebSites$PurchAmtControl))
cat("Standard Error of Control Group is:", sd(DataWebSites$PurchAmtControl)/sqrt(100))
```

. . .

**Treatment Group:**

```{r}
cat("Mean of Treatment Group is:", mean(DataWebSites$PurchAmtTreat))
cat("Standard Error of Treatment Group is:", sd(DataWebSites$PurchAmtTreat)/sqrt(100))
```

## Two Sample t-Test

**Assumption:** Same Variance

**Distribution:** Normal

**Method:**

-   Calculate difference between means

-   Difference between means will also be normal distributed

-   Standard error needs to be recalculated for difference and is approximately double the one of the treatment/control group.

-   **Hypothesis 0:** Difference is 0

-   **Goal:** If Treatment website is better, a difference of 0 should be very unlikely. (we reject the Null Hypothesis as being too unlikely)

## Two Sample t-Test

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
t.test(DataWebSites$PurchAmtControl,
       DataWebSites$PurchAmtTreat,
       var.equal=TRUE)
```

## Possible Problems with A/B Testing

### Omitting Variable Bias:

Omitting a variable that affects both the Treatment and the Outcome.

## Possible Problems with A/B Testing

### Imperfect Compliance and Selection Bias:

Imperfect compliance occurs when not all participants of an experiment adhere to their assigned treatment.

## Possible Problems with A/B Testing

### **Attrition Bias** :

When participants in the Control and Treatment groups leave but the dropout is not balanced (e.g.,unhappy customers leave):

## Possible Problems with A/B Testing

### Consequences

If biases exist we have to use techniques that can control for these biases, e.g., *Linear Regression*

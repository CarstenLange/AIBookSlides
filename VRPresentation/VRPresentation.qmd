## Goal of the Presentation

- Support instructors who want to use VR in their class
  - the use of VR is like a field trip. It provides immersiv experiences that would not be possible otherwise
  - like a field trip it requires preparation
  - goto [https://vr.lange-anlytics.com/hawkes](https://vr.lange-anlytics.com/hawkes){target="_blank} to connect and learn more about VR




## Overview

-   Status Quo of VR
    -   VR cannot be used (yet) to teach a complete course
    -   VR is more like a field trip. It provides immersive experiences that would not be possible otherwise, such as 3D interactive diagrams
-   How to start with Virtual Reality in your department
    -   Buying VR headsets
    -   VR lab vs. online teaching
    -   Student preparations
-   Demo of VR apps in statistics
    -   Multi player Simple Regression with breakout rooms
    -   Standalone app Displaying datasets and adjusting a regression plane with the Diagram Exhibition app

## VR Headset

-   Most common Meta-Quest 3 (128GB/512GB) \$299 and \$499

-   8 -- 15 VR headsets plus 1 instructor headsets are needed

    -   for practical (not technical) reasons it is difficult to manage more than 15 students at a time in a classroom setting without IT or teaching assistant support
    -   in one classroom meeting VR experiences can be delivered in two batches to half of a course at a time which allows class sizes between 16 and 30 students to be covered in one event
    -   if VR experience is delivered online rather than in a classroom the number of particiapnts is only limited by the number fo avaibale VR headsets

-   VR investment:

    -   for 8+1 VR headset: \$2,700 -- \$4,500 (128GB/512GB)
    -   for 30+1 VR headset: \$9,300 -- \$15,500 (128GB/512GB)

## VR Presentation & VR Larning Modes

## Additional Learning Modes

Both standalone app and horizon world

-   Self-Learner (asynchronous use of headsets by students)
-   Instructor only (instructor shares their View synchronous (in-class or on Zoom))
-   Instructor/Students Mode

## Welcome

> Using VR in education is like a field trip. <br><br> Field trips and educational VR experiences provide immerse and interactive experiences that would not be possible otherwise.<br><br> Like a field trip an educational VR experience requires preparation

## Goal of the Presentation {.smaller}

**Support instructors who plan using VR in their courses:**

-   Buying VR headsets
-   Student preparations
-   Classroom vs. VR-lab vs. online teaching
-   Stay updated: [https://vr.lange-analytics.com/hawkes.html](https://vr.lange-analytics.com/hawkes.html){target="_blank"}

**Demo two VR apps for statistics education:**

-   **Cloud-based:** Multi-player regression app (world) that supports a virtual classroom and also breakout rooms for groups of four.
-   **Standalone:** Exhibition style app featuring an interactive diagram in an exhibition hall. Various dataset collections can be loaded into the diagram.

**Real Estate Dataset to Predict House Prices:**<br><br>

. . .

**Lecture Hall Setting:**

$$\widehat{Price}=\beta_1 Quality + \beta_0$$

. . .

**Breakout Rooms (max. 4 students):**

$$\widehat{Price}=\beta_1 Sqft + \beta_0$$

(Sound will be added after the conference) :: ::

## Instructor View from Browser Version 
### Assessibility Option: Simple Regression World :: ::

**Browser App is Alternative for:**

- Students who are not able to use a VR headset

- Instructors & students, who currently do not have access to a VR headset

The Browser App is **fully functional**, but it does not provide an immersive experience

# How to Start Using VR for Education?

## Buying a VR Headset * ::

-   **Apple Vision Pro:** \$3499 -- \$3899 (256GB -- 1TB)

::: {.incremental}
-   **Galaxy XR (released 10/21/25):** \$1799 (512GB)

- <strong><span class="fragment highlight-red">Meta-Quest 3/3S:</span></strong> \$299 and \$499 (128GB/512GB)

:::

## VR for Education: Investment

<span class="highlight-red">**Meta-Quest 3/3S \$299/\$499 (128GB/512GB)**</span>

8 -- 16 VR headsets plus 1 instructor headsets are needed:

::: {.incremental}
-   for practical reasons, it is difficult to manage more than 16 students at a time in a classroom (take a TA if possible)
-   a VR experience  can be delivered in two batches (allows class sizes between 16 and 32 students)
:::

. . .

**Total Cost** 8+1 headsets (with GB128/GB256): **\$2,691 -- \$4,491**

. . .

**Total Cost** 16+1 headsets (with GB128/GB256): **\$5,083 -- \$8,483**

## Student Preparation Check-List 

::: {.incremental}
1. Ask about **pre-existing conditions** like epilepsy
2. Inform students about **possible vertigo**  and to stop early
3. The **browser version provides** a good work-around for students who cannot use a VR headset
3. Deliver the experience in **sitting not standing mode** 
4. Run headsets in **tunnel-mode**
5. Introduce how to use  controllers to move around and to select items
6. Explain how to enter the world or to start the app
::: 

## Classroom vs. VR-Lab vs. Online

**Cloud based *Horizon World* requires high WiFi bandwidth**

. . .

**Work-Arounds:**


  - VR-Lab provides high bandwidth

::: {.incremental}
  - Work with groups of about 8 students
  - All or some students use their cell phone as a WiFi hotspot
  - Send some students (together with a TA) to another WiFi access point location
  - Teach the VR experience online
:::

. . .
  
**Alternative: Standalone Apps have no or low WiFi requirements**

## Diagram Exhibition App: Pre-Loaded Collection of Datasets

**Various collection of datasets** are available. Each has two codes: even for instructors and odd codes for students.

. . .

The **instructor can change the datasets** in a collection.<br> Simultaneously, **students' datasets change** in their VR headset.

## Dataset Collections Currently Avaiable 

Even codes are for instructors, odd codes are for students

::: {.incremental}
- **Multivar. Regression (uncorrel. predictors):** `590001 & 590002`<br>

- **The Problem with Mulicollinearity:** `coming soon`<br>

- **Random Forest Prediction:** `590003 & 590004`<br>

- **Degrees of Freedom in Regression:** `590005 & 590006`<br>

- **Your dataset collection goes here:** `e.g., 592301 & 592302`

## Welcome

> Using VR in education is like a field trip. <br><br> Field trips and educational VR experiences provide immerse and interactive experiences that would not be possible otherwise.<br><br> Like a field trip educational VR experiences requires preparation

## Goal of the Presentation {.smaller}

**Support instructors who plan using VR in their courses:**

-   Buying VR headsets
-   Student preparations
-   VR lab vs. online teaching
-   Stay updated: [https://vr.lange-analytics.com/hawkes.html](https://vr.lange-analytics.com/hawkes.html){target="_blank"}

**Demo two VR apps for statistics education:**

-   **Cloud-based:** Multi-player regression app (world) that supports a virtual classroom and also breakout rooms for groups of four.
-   **Standalone:** Exhibition style app featuring an interactive diagram in an exhibition hall. Various dataset collections can be loaded into the diagram.

## Buying a VR Headset

-   **Apple Vision Pro:** \$3499 -- \$3899 (256GB -- 1TB)

-   **Galaxy XR (released 10/21/25):** \$1799 (512GB)

- <strong><span class="fragment highlight-red">Meta-Quest 3/3S:</span></strong> \$299 and \$499 (128GB/512GB)

## VR for Education: Investment

**Meta-Quest 3/3S \$299/\$499 (128GB/512GB)**

8 -- 16 VR headsets plus 1 instructor headsets are needed:

-   for practical reasons, it is difficult to manage more than 16 students at a time in a classroom (take a TA if possible)
-   a VR experience  can be delivered in two batches (allows class sizes between 16 and 32 students)

**Total Cost** 8+1 headsets (with GB128/GB256): **\$2,691 -- \$4,491**

**Total Cost** 16+1 headsets (with GB128/GB256): **\$5,083 -- \$8,483**

## Student Preparation Check-List 

::: {.incremental}
1. Ask about **pre-existing** conditions like epilepsy
2. Inform students about **possible vertigo**  and to stop early.
3. The **browser version provides** a good work-around in case of 1. and 2.
3. Deliver the experience in **sitting not standing mode**. 
4. Run headsets in **tunnel-mode**.
5. Introduce how to use  controllers to move around and to select items. 
6. Explain how to enter the world or to start the app.

## Classroom vs. VR-Lab vs. Online

**Cloud based *Horizon World* requires high WiFi bandwidth**

**Work-Arounds:**
  - VR-Lab provides high bandwidth
  - Work with groups of about 8 students 
  - All or some students use their cell phone as a WiFi hotspot
  - Send some students (together with a TA) to another WiFi access point location
  
**Alternative: Standalone Apps have no or low requirements:**

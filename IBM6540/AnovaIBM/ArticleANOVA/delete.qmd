Although we obtained an F-value of $F = 594.8$, we cannot immediately rule out the possibility that this result was due to **random chance** — that is, a fluke in our sample — and that the true F-value under the null hypothesis might still be 1.

**However, we can assess how likely it would be to obtain such a high F-value if Hypothesis 0 were true.**

To do this, we calculate a **p-value**, which represents the probability of observing an F-statistic as extreme as the one we found — **assuming the null hypothesis is true**.

According to @eq-FValue, the F-distribution for this test depends on two degrees of freedom:

- The numerator degrees of freedom (between-group):  
  $df_1 = df_{\text{restr}} - df_{\text{full}} = 341 - 339 = 2$
  
- The denominator degrees of freedom (within-group/residual):  
  $df_2 = df_{\text{full}} = 339$

Since our observed F-value is far greater than 1, we are conducting a **right-tailed test** — testing the probability of observing an F-value as large as 594.8 or larger.

We can compute this in *R* using the `pf()` function:

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| message: false
PValue = pf(594.8, df1 = 2, df2 = 339, lower.tail = FALSE)
cat("The chance to get such a high F-value if Hypothesis 0 were true is (in scientific notation):", PValue)

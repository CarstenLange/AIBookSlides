**Step 2:**  
The **Sum of Squared Errors** for the **full model**, which includes the predictors *Audio* and *Video*, is listed in the **Residuals** row (third row) of the ANOVA table:

\[
SSE_{\text{full}} = 14,\!953
\]

> üîç **Note:** The first row of the table (often labeled *Treatment*) is included primarily for convenience and interpretability. However, all values required to compute the F-statistic using @eq-FValue can be derived entirely from the **second and third rows** of the output produced by `anova()`.

Specifically:

- The numerator of the F formula:  
  \[
  SSE_{\text{restr}} - SSE_{\text{full}} = 67,\!426 - 14,\!953 = 52,\!473
  \]
  comes directly from the **Treatment row**.

- The difference in degrees of freedom:
  \[
  df_{\text{restr}} - df_{\text{full}} = 341 - 339 = 2
  \]
  also appears in the table, allowing you to compute the F-statistic **without needing to extract separate model components manually**.

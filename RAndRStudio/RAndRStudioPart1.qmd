## Install and Setup R and RStudio

A typical setup to work with R consists of two components:

::: nonincremental
-   the **R Console** which executes R code and

-   an integrated development environment (IDE) such as **RStudio**.
:::

You can download R here: [Download R](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/){target="_blank"}

You can download RStudio here: [Download RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download){target="_blank"}

Detailed installation guides are provided in the Book and the Online Resources sections of this chapter in book.

:::

## Recommended RStudio Settings

1.**Do not Restore .RData into workspace at startup:**\
`Tools -> GlobalOptions`.

2.  **Work with R Projects:** This assigns a directory on your hard drive to your R analysis: `File -> New Project`

First steps to setup R can be found in this video: [Click here](https://youtu.be/LmRtTkD5E6M)

## R Packages {.smaller}

R Packages extend R's functionality. They have to be **installed** only once:

`Tools -> Install Packages ...`

After installation they need to be **loaded** in every new R script with `library()`.

Packages frequently used in this course (**please install soon**):

-   `tidyverse`: supports easy data processing .
-   `rio`: allows loading various data resources with one `import()` command from the user's hard drive or the Internet.
-   `janitor`: provides functionality to clean data and rename variable names to avoid spaces and special characters.
-   `tidymodels`: streamlines data engineering and machine learning tasks.
-   `kableExtra`: supports rendering tables in HTML.
-   `shiny`: needed together with the `learnr` package for the interactive exercises in the book.
-   `learnr` package: together with the `shiny` package for the interactive exercises in the book.

## Example: the `rio` and the `tidyverse` Package

Assuming the `rio` packages is already installed.

Example: How to install the tidyverse package: [Click here](https://youtu.be/tAGoThXF2Os)

Video about the rio package: [Click here](https://youtu.be/8N_5sR4s8XE)



```{r}
#| echo: true
library(rio);library(tidyverse)
DataHousing =
  import("https://ai.lange-analytics.com/data/HousingData.csv") |> 
  select(Price=price, Sqft=sqft_living, Bedrooms=bedrooms,Waterfront=waterfront)
print(DataHousing[1:3,])
```

`import()` would not work if the `rio` package were not loaded.

`select()` would not work if the `tidyverse` package were not loaded.

## Data Types & Data Objects

::: nonincremental
-   **Data Types:** What can R store?

    -   numerical `num`
    -   character `chr`
    -   `factor`
    -   `logic`

-   **Data Objects:** What are the **containers** R uses to store data?

    -   `single entry` single variable
    -   list of entries `vectors`
    -   table `dataframe` and `tibble`
    -   *advanced objects*. E.g., for plot, models, prediction results
:::

## Data Types  ðŸ¤“ {.scrollable .smaller}

::: panel-tabset
### Main

**Numerical Data Type (`num`):** Numerical values (e.g., 1, 523, 3.45) are used for calculation. In contrast, ZIP-Codes are not numerical data type.

**Character Data Type (`chr`):** Storing sequence of characters, numbers, and/or symbols to form a word or even a sentence is called a `character` data type (e.g. first or last names, street addresses, or Zip-codes)

**Factor Data Type (`factor`):** A `factor` is an R data type that stores *categorical* data in an effective way. `factor` data types are also required by many classification models in R.

**Logic Data Type(`logic`):** A data type that stores the logic states `TRUE` and `FALSE` is called a `logic` object (sometimes called Boolean)

### Numerical

**Numerical Data Type (`num`):** Numerical values are used for calculations (therefore ZIP-Codes are not numerical). Numerical data can be discrete (`integer`) or continuous (`double`).

```{r}
#| output-location: fragment
#| echo: true
A=as.integer(2)
B=as.integer(3)
str(A) # str() returns structure of a variable
C=1.23
str(C) # str() returns structure of a variable
print(A*C)
A^B
A/B # Returns num type
```

### Character

**Character Data Type (`chr`):**

Note that what is called a `character` in R is often called a *string* in other programming languages.

`character` data types must be surrounded by quotes:

```{r}
#| output-location: fragment
#| echo: true
MyText="Hello world!"
print(MyText)
```

Character variables can be concatenated with the `cat()` command:

```{r}
#| output-location: fragment
#| echo: true
FirstName="Carsten"
LastName="Lange"
cat(FirstName, LastName) # R adds a space automatically
```

### Factor

A `factor` is an R data type that stores *categorical* data in an effective way. *Categorical* data are `character` type data covering a few categories such as hair color (blonde, braun, red, black). They can be coded with numbers (e.g., from 1-5 for hair color) and thus use less memory. Another example is sex (male, female).

```{r }
#| code-fold: true
#| echo: true
People=tribble(~Name,~Sex,
                  "John", "male",
                  "Jane", "female",
                  "Mia", "female",
                  "Brid", "female",
                  "Greg", "male")
print(People)
```

Sex is a `charcter` variable in the dataset `People`

```{r}
#| output-location: fragment
#| echo: true
str(People$Sex)

```

Transforming the variable $Sex$ to a factor and looking at its structure (`str()`) again:

```{r}
#| output-location: fragment
#| echo: true
str(as.factor(People$Sex))
```

### Logic

**Logic variables**: Store `TRUE` and `FALSE`. They can be combined with `and`/`or`. Internally `True` is stored as $1$ and `False` is stored as $0$

```{r}
#| output-location: fragment
#| echo: true
IsConcertGood=FALSE 
IsCompanyGood=TRUE
cat("Is the concert good?", IsConcertGood, "Is the company good?", IsCompanyGood)
```

```{r}
#| output-location: fragment
#| echo: true
IsEveningAmazing=IsConcertGood & IsCompanyGood
cat("Is the evening amazing?", IsEveningAmazing)
```

```{r}
#| output-location: fragment
#| echo: true
IsEveningGood=IsConcertGood | IsCompanyGood # | stands for "or"
cat("Is the evening good?", IsEveningGood)
```

```{r}
#| output-location: fragment
#| echo: true
IsConcertGood+IsCompanyGood+17
```

### Truth Table

```{r}
library(kableExtra)
DataTruthTable=tribble(~A,~B,~"A&B",~"A|B",
                       T,T,T,T,
                       T,F,F,T,
                       F,T,F,T,
                       F,F,F,F)
kable(DataTruthTable, caption="Truth Table for AND and OR")|>
  add_header_above(c("R object A","R object B","A and B","A or B")) |> 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options=c("striped","hover"), position="center", full_width = F)
```

## Data Types & Data Objects

**Data Types:** What can R store?

**Data Objects:** What are the containers R uses to store data?

## Data Objects 

-   **Single Value Object**
-   **Vector Object**
-   **Data Frame (Tibble) Object**
-   **List Object** (not covered in this course)
-   **Advanced Object** such as plots, models, recipes



## Single Value Object

Object just stores a single value:

```{r}
#| echo: true
A=123.768
B=3
C="Hello World"
IsLifeGood=TRUE
```

## Vector-Objects

A vector object stores a list of values (numerical, character, factor, or logic)

Example: Weather during the last three days in Stattown:

```{r}
#| echo: true
VecTemp=c(70, 68, 55)
VecWindSpeed=c("low","low","high")
VecIsSunny=c(TRUE,TRUE,FALSE)
```

Vector objects can be used as arguments for an R command to calculate:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-fold: true
MeanForecTemp=mean(VecTemp)
cat("The average forecasted temperature is", MeanForecTemp)
```

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-fold: true
ForecDays=length(VecTemp)
cat("The forecast is for", ForecDays, "days.")
```

## Data Frames (tibbles)

A data frame is similar to an Excel table (note not all columns of the Titanic data frame are shown).

```{r}
library(rio); library(kableExtra)
DataTitanic=import("https://ai.lange-analytics.com/data/Titanic.csv") |> 
  select(-Name, -SiblingsSpousesAboard, -ParentsChildrenAboard)
kbl(DataTitanic[1:12,])
```

A data frame consist of vectors making up the columns. These are the variables for the data analysis (remember: observations are in the rows, variables are in the columns).

```{r}
#| echo: true
DataTitanic=import("https://ai.lange-analytics.com/data/Titanic.csv")
str(DataTitanic)
```

## Extracting the Vectors and Perform Calculations (numerical Vectors)

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: fragment
VecFareInPounds=DataTitanic$FareInPounds
AvgFare=mean(VecFareInPounds)
cat("The average fare of Titanic passengers was:", AvgFare, "British Pounds")
```

## Extracting the Vectors and Perform Calculations (logical Vectors)

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: fragment
DataTitanic$Survived=as.logical(DataTitanic$Survived)
str(DataTitanic)
```

```{r }
#| echo: true
#| output-location: fragment
SurvRate=mean(DataTitanic$Survived)
cat("The average survival rate of Titanic passengers was:", SurvRate)
```

## Data Frames vs. Tibbles ðŸ¤“ {.smaller .scrollable}

A **tibble** is a more advanced sub-type of a *data frame*. If needed, a regular *data frame* can be coerced into a *tibble* with the `as_tibble()` command.

A few of the differences between *data frames* and *tibbles*:

1.  A *data frame* outputs all its rows and columns by default. A *tibble* outputs only the first 10 rows and the variables that fit on the screen but provides information about omitted variables and rows.

2.  A *data frame* can have row names, while a *tibble* cannot.

3.  In R version \<4.1 a *data frame* converts all *character* values to *factor* type. This conversion was often confusing and annoying. In contrast, a *tibble* only coerces *character* values into *factor* on demand. Since R version 4.1 regular `data frames` behave the same as `tibbles`.

## Summary Data Types and Objects

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/DataObjectDataTypes.png")
```


## How are Very Big Numbers Presented {.smaller}


The GDP for 2021 in the US was $ 22,996,086,000,000 (rounded to millions)

\begin{eqnarray*}
GDP&=&2.2996086 \cdot 10000000000000\\
&\Longleftrightarrow&\\
GDP&=&2.2996086 \cdot 10\cdot 10\cdot 10\cdot 10\cdot 10\cdot 10\cdot 10\cdot 10\cdot 10\cdot 10\cdot 10\cdot 10\cdot 10 \\
&\Longleftrightarrow&\\
GDP&=&2.2996086 \cdot 10^{13}
\end{eqnarray*}

Let us see what R does:

```{r}
#| echo: true
GDPUS=22996086000000
print(GDPUS)

```




## How are Very Small Numbers Presented ðŸ¤“ {.smaller}

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Main 

The probability of getting struck by lightning in the US is about $0.000000000365$ on any randomly chosen day.

\begin{eqnarray*}
ProbLight&=&\frac{3.65}{10000000000} \\
&\Longleftrightarrow&\\
ProbLight&=&\frac{3.65}{10\cdot 10\cdot 10\cdot 10\cdot 10\cdot                              10\cdot 10\cdot 10\cdot 10\cdot 10} \\
&\Longleftrightarrow&\\
ProbLight&=&\frac{3.65}{10^{10}}\\
&\Longleftrightarrow&\\
ProbLight&=&3.65 \cdot 10^{-10}
\end{eqnarray*}


### Why?

In the U.S., a person has a 1:10,000-lifetime risk of being struck by lightning. Assuming a life span of 75 years and 365.25 days per year, the probability per day is:

$$\frac{1}{10,000 \cdot 365.25\cdot 75)}=0.000000000365$$
### What R Does  

Let us see what R does:

```{r}
#| echo: true
ProbStruck=0.000000000365
cat("Probabilty to get stuck by a lighning on an avg. day:", ProbStruck)
```
